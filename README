# Throttle
C++ throttle mechanism for Order Management.


The function of `class Throttle` is to maintain and control the TPS rate in a given window.For example 10 msg every second. A call to `waitTurn` creates a new msg
and checks if the rate was reached. If it has, it waits the appropriate amount of time before returning. The call returns the number of milliseconds it needed to wait.
